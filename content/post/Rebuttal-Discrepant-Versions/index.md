## Rebuttal Discrepant Versions

The empirical study of Discrepant Versions are updated in [7.empirical](https://github.com/vision-version/vision-version.github.io/tree/main/Vision/7.empirical), in where, you can find the [cve versions](https://github.com/vision-version/vision-version.github.io/tree/main/Vision/7.empirical/cve_tags.json), [cve mapped github repos](https://github.com/vision-version/vision-version.github.io/tree/main/Vision/7.empirical/cve_github_map.json) and [cve mapped maven libraries](https://github.com/vision-version/vision-version.github.io/tree/main/Vision/7.empirical/cve_ga_map.json). Because multiple maven libraries can map to one repository, there are inconsistencies between libraries and repositories.

We provide the script to fetch all versions from Maven and GitHub, you can find the final result in [empirical_final_results_0725.json](https://github.com/vision-version/vision-version.github.io/tree/main/Vision/7.empirical/empirical_final_results_0725.json)
